# Minecraft Clone 2D

### This is NOT official project by Mojang studios
</br>

**Minecraft 2D is python recreation of scratch project Paper Minecraft made by Griffpatch.
It's 2D Minecraft clone - you can mine and place blocks, move around, but survival mode and inventory are still in development.
It runs on 30fps - when I finish new rendering should be able to run 60fps.
I'm currently working on multiplayer mode.**</br></br>
