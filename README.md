# Minecraft Clone 2D

### This is NOT an official project by Mojang Studios
</br>

**Minecraft 2D is a Python recreation of the Scratch project Paper Minecraft by Griffpatch.
It's a 2D Minecraft clone—you can mine and place blocks, move around, but survival mode and inventory are still in development.**</br></br>
