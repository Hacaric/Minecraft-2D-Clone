# Minecraft Clone 2D

### This is NOT an official project by Mojang Studios
</br>

**Minecraft 2D is a Python recreation of the Scratch project Paper Minecraft by Griffpatch.
It's a 2D Minecraft cloneâ€”you can mine and place blocks, move around, but survival mode and inventory are still in development.
It runs at 30fps; once I finish new rendering, it should be able to run at 60fps.
I'm currently working on multiplayer mode.**</br></br>
